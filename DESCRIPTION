Description: Provides a consistent interface for downloading, storing, and
    accessing immune receptor (TCR/BCR) and HLA sequences from IMGT,
    IPD-IMGT/HLA, and OGRDB (AIRR-C). Supports export to popular analysis
    tools including MiXCR, TRUST4, Cell Ranger, and IgBLAST. This package
    serves as a core dependency for immunogenomics packages, ensuring
    reliable and high-quality sequence access with local caching for
    reproducibility.
